# Data-Science-Zoo-Animal-Classification-Project
This project aims to provide an implementation and analysis of the various clustering techniques for animal classification and to explore potentially how these methods can be improved using Gradient Boosting. In this project, we will perform a classification analysis of animal data using three different methods: k-means, Gaussian mixtures, and random forest. The data consists of various properties and features of each animal, which will be used to create models and group them into different classes. K-means is a clustering algorithm that partitions data into k-clusters based on their similarity. Gaussian mixtures, on the other hand, use a probabilistic approach to clustering, where data points are modeled as a mixture of Gaussian distributions. Lastly, random forest is a classification algorithm that constructs a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputs the class which is the mode of the classes of the individual trees. The accuracy of each method will be evaluated to determine which one performs best for this particular classification task. The results of the analysis will provide insight into the properties and features that differentiate the different animal classes and can be useful for various applications, and give us insight into the methods of classification and clustering.
